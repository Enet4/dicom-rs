//! This crates contains the types and methods needed to interact
//! with DICOM nodes through the upper layer protocol.
//!
//! This crate can be used as a base
//! for finite-state machines and higher-level helpers,
//! enabling the creation of concrete service class users (SCUs)
//! and service class providers (SCPs).
//!
//! - The [`address`] module
//!   provides an abstraction for working with compound addresses
//!   referring to application entities in a network.
//! - The [`pdu`] module
//!   provides data structures representing _protocol data units_,
//!   which are passed around as part of the DICOM network communication support.
//! - The [`association`] module
//!   comprises abstractions for establishing and negotiating associations
//!   between application entities,
//!   via the upper layer protocol by TCP.
//!
//! ## Features
//! * `async`: Enables a fully async implementation of the upper layer protocol.
//!   See [`ClientAssociationOptions`] and [`ServerAssociationOptions`] for details
//! * `sync-tls`: Enables TLS support for synchronous associations.
//! * `async-tls`: Enables TLS support for asynchronous associations.
