//! Core module for building pixel data adapters.
//!
//! This module contains the core types and traits
//! for consumers and implementers of
//! transfer syntaxes with encapsulated pixel data.
//!
//! Complete DICOM object types
//! (such as `FileDicomObject<InMemDicomObject>`)
//! implement the [`PixelDataObject`] trait.
//! Transfer syntaxes which define an encapsulated pixel data encoding
//! need to provide suitable implementations of
//! [`PixelDataReader`] and [`PixelDataWriter`]
//! to be able to decode and encode imaging data, respectively.
