//! Module containing the DICOM Transfer Syntax data structure and related methods.
//! Similar to the DcmCodec in DCMTK, the `TransferSyntax` contains all of the necessary
//! algorithms for decoding and encoding DICOM data in a certain transfer syntax.
//!
//! This crate does not host specific transfer syntaxes. Instead, they are created in
//! other crates and registered in the global transfer syntax registry, which implements
//! [`TransferSyntaxIndex`]. For more
//! information, please see the `dicom-transfer-syntax-registry` crate.
